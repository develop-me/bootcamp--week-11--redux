# Day 2

## ReactRedux
- Few issues:
    - Multiple components means passing props everywhere
    - Whole app re-renders when any state changes
- Could pass `store` down, then it's only one thing, but ties React to Redux
- ReactRedux: lets you pass values in at any point by creating wrapper components
- `npm install react-redux`
- `<Provider store={ store }>`
- Gives us a `connect()` function
- Handles re-renders, so don't need to subscribe ourselves
- Split out reducers and initial state while we're at it
- Context API: implementation detail

## Subscribe
- Split iCounter into separate components: use `index.jsx`
- Explain container components: diagram
- Wrap `<Value>`
- Don't need to pass `value` around anymore
- Demonstrate own props: pass in offset
    - Into `<Value>` and into container
