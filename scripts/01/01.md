# Day 1

- Structure of week
- Structure of day

## Architecture

- Hardest topic in programming
- Talk about how lots of things interact with one another in Trello
- One way data flow in React means we'd need to lift state
- Two way data flow would mean it's hard to know where logic goes
- Black boxes: functions, PHP Interfaces, React Components
- Keep things simple, small parts that do one thing well
- React Redux: build complex apps out of simple components

## Redux
- Handles app state management
- Store, actions, reducers
- Lifting state all the way

- Create new, over engineered, app
- Use App.jsx template
- Initial state
- Increment reducer
- Test reducer
- Create the store
- Create a subscribe function: `console.log(state)`
- Dispatch an increment action
- Recap: initial state, reducer, store, subscribe, action - that's all there is to Redux

- Wrap the React render code with subscribe
- Pass in `value` and handlers
- Accept inside App.jsx
- Show Redux dev tools at work
- Add decrement and reset reducers
- Show payload by switching to `change` action
- Pull out `change` reducer to function

- Add `localStorage` support

```
npm install redux-localstorage


import { createStore, compose } from "redux";
import persistState from "redux-localstorage";


const composeEnhancers =
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
const store = createStore(
    reducer,
    initial,
    composeEnhancers(persistState())
);
```

- What goes in state? React & React Native / English & Spanish
- Why!? Talk about some advantages
    - all business logic in one place
    - components are reusable, not tied to specific use
    - could get rid of React
    - all state in place, localStorage trick is easy
    - e.g. Trello background image change
