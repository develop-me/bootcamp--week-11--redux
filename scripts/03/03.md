# Day 3

## Dispatch
- Don't want to pass in event handlers
- Can also use `connect` to handle event handlers/dispatch
- Setup `<Buttons>` with `mapDispatchToProps`
- Use action creators

## Forms
- Use ReactRouter to create a settings page with a "Step" value
- Add link to "Settings" from home-page
- Talk about using controlled components for forms
- Local state if it doesn't need storing long term
- Need to get `step` from state, so need `mapStateToProps`
- Need to deal with submit: `mapDispatchToProps`
- Need a new action `SAVE_SETTINGS`: needs payload data
- **Actions represent events**
- Pass data up
- Use Redux Dev Tools
- Need to update reducer
- Get `history` working: add to `ReactRouter` and use `history.push("/")`

    ```js
    import { createBrowserHistory } from "history";
    export default createBrowserHistory();
    ```

    ```js
    import Router from "react-router";
    import history from "./history";

    //...

    <Router history={ history }>
    ```

- Update `mapDispatchToProps`
