# Day 4

## APIs
- `localStorage` no good for non-toy apps: can't share, different machines
- Get rid of `persistState`
- Need to store API request somewhere
    - Can't use components (view)
    - Can't use containers (view)
    - Can't use reducer (pure)
- Need to use `redux-thunk`: dispatch a function, gets given `dispatch`
- Setting up: `composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk))`
- Axios config
- Create a `<Loading>` component: wrap main and settings in Router, don't want to change existing components
- Create a `getCounter` API request
- Call on `componentDidMount`
- Add reducer
- Only call `handleLoad` if `loaded` is false
- Create `putStep` API action
- Reuse `SAVE_SETTINGS` state action
